### Community leadership

I'm the creator and organizer of [Baltimore NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/baltimore), where we use open-source command-line lessons to teach various Node.js-related concepts every month, for free.

In addition to official NodeSchool events, I teach JavaScript courses at events run by organizations such as [Baltimore Innovation Week](http://2014.baltimoreinnovationweek.com/events/dev_day-2) and [Girl Develop It](http://www.girldevelopit.com/). 

### Training experience

In addition to NodeSchool events, where I organize and facilitate having TA mentors co-teach Node.js concepts to 30-50 attendees, I also create screencast tutorial courses that are usually about 90-120 minutes in length on many different topics for the site http://tutsplus.com
