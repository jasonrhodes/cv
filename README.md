### Community leadership

I'm the creator and organizer of [Baltimore NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/baltimore), where I organize monthly meetings during which we teach people various Node.js related concepts using open-source command-line lessons.

In addition to official NodeSchool events, I teach JavaScript courses for events like [Baltimore Innovation Week](http://2014.baltimoreinnovationweek.com/events/dev_day-2) and non-profit groups such as [Girl Develop It](http://www.girldevelopit.com/). 

### Open-source contributions

I've contributed in small part to many different projects but my favorite contributions recently have been to the http://revisit.link project, which "encourages developers to build small, focused code projects called services to manipulate images files in amazing ways". I've contributed several services that use the following two libraries:

[GifPlay](https://github.com/jasonrhodes/revisit-gifplay) accepts animated GIFs and plays with the individual frames. Services here include shuffle, pingpong (running the image forward and backward in a loop), and slow-mo (adding delay to every 3rd frame), among others.

[Markov Memeify](https://github.com/jasonrhodes/meatspace-markov-memeify) takes 24 hours worth of my favorite chat room's logs, runs a markov chain filter through the text, and produces a 1-4 word phrase that is overlaid on a JPEG or PNG image using node-canvas and the always popular Impact font.
